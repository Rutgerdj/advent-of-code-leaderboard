## Advent of Code leaderboard

### Installation
At this time it is only possible to use the extension on a chromium based browser.
Can be installed as follows:\
settings -> more tools -> extensions -> toggle developer mode -> load unpacked

### Setup
You need to set a leaderboard identifier before the extension can work.\
This can be done by clicking on the extension icon in your browsers' menubar. In the popup you can set the leaderboardId (as well as a username).
